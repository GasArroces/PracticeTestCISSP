    {
      question: "1. Lisa is attempting to prevent her network from being targeted by IP spoofing attacks as well as preventing her network from being the source of those attacks. Which of the following rules are best practices that Lisa should configure at her network border? (Select all that apply.)",
        options: [
            "A. Block packets with internal source addresses from entering the network.",
            "B. Block packets with external source addresses from leaving the network.",
            "C. Block packets with public IP addresses from entering the network.",
            "D. Block packets with private IP addresses from exiting the network."
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["A", "B", "D"],
        explanation: "Packets with public IP addresses will routinely be allowed to enter the network, so you should not create a rule to block them. Packets with internal source addresses should never originate from outside the network, so they should be blocked from entering the network. Packets with external source addresses should never be found on the internal network, so they should be blocked from leaving the network. Finally, private IP addresses should never be used on the Internet, so packets containing private IP addresses should be blocked from leaving the network."

        question: "2. Ed has been tasked with identifying a service that will provide a low-latency, high-performance, and high-availability way to host content for his employer. What type of solution should he seek out to ensure that his employer's customers around the world can access their content quickly, easily, and reliably?",
        options: [
            "A. A hot site",
            "B. A CDN",
            "C. Redundant servers",
            "D. A P2P CDN"
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["B"],
        explanation: "A content distribution network (CDN) is designed to provide reliable, low-latency, geographically distributed content distribution. In this scenario, a CDN is an ideal solution. A P2P CDN like BitTorrent isn't a typical choice for a commercial entity, whereas redundant servers or a hot site can provide high availability but won't provide the remaining requirements."

    {
        question: "3. Fran is building a forensic analysis workstation and is selecting a forensic disk controller to include in the setup. Which of the following are functions of a forensic disk controller? (Select all that apply.)",
        options: [
            "A. Preventing the modification of data on a storage device",
            "B. Returning data requested from the device",
            "C. Reporting errors sent by the device to the forensic host",
            "D. Blocking read commands sent to the device"
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["A", "B", "C"],
        explanation: "A forensic disk controller performs four functions. One of those, write blocking, intercepts write commands sent to the device and prevents them from modifying data on the device. The other three functions include returning data requested by a read operation, returning access-significant information from the device, and reporting errors from the device back to the forensic host. The controller should not prevent read commands from being sent to the device because those commands may return crucial information."

        question: "4. Mike is building a fault-tolerant server and wants to implement RAID 1. How many physical disks are required to build this solution?",
        options: [
            "A. 1",
            "B. 2",
            "C. 3",
            "D. 5"
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["B"],
        explanation: "RAID 1, disk mirroring, requires two physical disks that will contain copies of the same data."
    },
    {
        question: "5. Darren is troubleshooting an authentication issue for a Kerberized application used by his organization. He believes the issue is with the generation of session keys. What Kerberos service should he investigate first?",
        options: [
            "A. KDC",
            "B. TGT",
            "C. AS",
            "D. TGS"
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["D"],
        explanation: "The TGS, or ticket-granting service (which is usually on the same server as the KDC), receives a TGT from the client. It validates the TGT and the user's rights to access the service they are requesting to use. The TGS then issues a ticket and session keys to the client. The AS serves as the authentication server, which forwards the username to the KDC. It's worth noting that the client doesn't communicate with the KDC directly. Instead, it will communicate with the TGT and the AS, which means KDC isn't an appropriate answer here."

        question: "6. Evelyn believes that one of her organization's vendors has breached a contractual obligation to protect sensitive data and would like to conduct an investigation into the circumstances. Based upon the results of the investigation, it is likely that Evelyn's organization will sue the vendor for breach of contract. What term best describes the type of investigation that Evelyn is conducting?",
        options: [
            "A. Administrative investigation",
            "B. Criminal investigation",
            "C. Civil investigation",
            "D. Regulatory investigation"
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["C"],
        explanation: "This is an example of a civil investigation because it relates to a contract dispute and will likely wind up being litigated in civil court. Administrative investigations are for internal purposes and are not applicable when a third party is being investigated. Criminal and regulatory investigations may only be initiated by those with regulatory authority, typically government agencies."

        question: "7. Ivan is installing a motion detector to protect a sensitive work area that uses high-frequency microwave signal transmissions to identify potential intruders. What type of detector is he installing?",
        options: [
            "A. Infrared",
            "B. Heat-based",
            "C. Wave pattern",
            "D. Capacitance"
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["C"],
        explanation: "Wave pattern motion detectors transmit ultrasonic or microwave signals into the monitored area, watching for changes in the returned signals bouncing off objects. Infrared heat-based detectors watch for unusual heat patterns. Capacitance detectors work based upon electromagnetic fields."

    {
        question: "8. Susan sets up a firewall that keeps track of the status of the communication between two systems and allows a remote system to respond to a local system only after the local system starts communication. What type of firewall is Susan using?",
        options: [
            "A. A static packet filtering firewall",
            "B. An application-level gateway firewall",
            "C. A stateful packet inspection firewall",
            "D. A circuit-level gateway firewall"
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["C"],
        explanation: "Stateful packet inspection firewalls, also known as dynamic packet filtering firewalls, track the state of a conversation and can allow a response from a remote system based on an internal system being allowed to start the communication. Static packet filtering and circuit-level gateways only filter based on source and destination IP addresses and ports along with the protocol being used, whereas application-level gateway firewalls proxy traffic for specific applications."

    {
        question: "9. Ben owns a coffeehouse and wants to provide wireless Internet service for his customers. Ben's network is simple and uses a single consumer-grade wireless router and a cable modem connected via a commercial cable data contract. How can Ben provide access control for his customers without having to provision user IDs before they connect while also gathering useful contact information for his business purposes?",
        options: [
            "A. WPA2-PSK.",
            "B. A captive portal.",
            "C. Require customers to use a publicly posted password like 'BensCoffee.'",
            "D. WPA3 SAE."
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["B"],
        explanation: "A captive portal can require those who want to connect to and use Wi-Fi to provide an email address to connect. This allows Ben to provide easy-to-use wireless while meeting his business purposes. WPA2-PSK is the preshared key mode of WPA and won't provide information about users who are given a key. WPA3's SAE mode would be preferable to WPA2-PSK, but it still does not allow for the data gathering Ben desires. Sharing a password doesn't allow for data gathering either."
    },
    {
        question: "10. Ben intends to run an open (unencrypted) wireless network for his customers. How should he connect his wireless business devices?",
        options: [
            "A. Run WPA3 on the same SSID.",
            "B. Set up a separate SSID using WPA3.",
            "C. Run the open network in Enterprise mode.",
            "D. Set up a separate wireless network using WEP."
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["B"],
        explanation: "Many modern wireless routers can provide multiple SSIDs. Ben can create a private, secure network for his business operations, but he will need to make sure that the customer and business networks are firewalled or otherwise logically separated from each other. Running WPA3 on the same SSID isn't possible without creating another wireless network and would cause confusion for customers (SSIDs aren't required to be unique). Running a network in Enterprise mode isn't used for open networks, and WEP is outdated and incredibly vulnerable."
    },
         {
        question: "11. After implementing the solution from the first question, Ben receives a complaint about users in his cafe hijacking other customers' web traffic, including using their usernames and passwords. How is this possible?",
        options: [
            "A. The password is shared by all users, making traffic vulnerable.",
            "B. A malicious user has installed a Trojan on the router.",
            "C. A user has ARP spoofed the router, making all traffic broadcast to all users.",
            "D. Open networks are unencrypted, making traffic easily sniffable."
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["D"],
        explanation: "Unencrypted open networks broadcast traffic in the clear. This means that unencrypted sessions to websites can be easily captured with a packet sniffer. Some tools like FireSheep have been specifically designed to capture sessions from popular websites. Fortunately, many websites now use TLS by default, but other sites still send user session information in the clear. Shared passwords are not the cause of the vulnerability, ARP spoofing isn't an issue with wireless networks, and a Trojan is designed to look like safe software, not to compromise a router."

        question: "12. Kevin is reviewing and updating the security documentation used by his organization. He would like to document some best practices for securing IoT devices that his team has developed over the past year. The practices are generalized in nature and do not cover specific devices. What type of document would be best for this purpose?",
        options: [
            "A. Policy",
            "B. Standard",
            "C. Guideline",
            "D. Procedure"
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["C"],
        explanation: "It is possible that Kevin could use any one of these documents. We should zero in on the portion of the question where it indicates that these are best practices. This implies that the advice is not mandatory and, therefore, would not go into a policy or standard. The fact that the advice is general in nature means that it is likely not well-suited to the step-by-step nature of a procedure. A guideline would be the perfect place to document these best practices."

        question: "13. Tom is tuning his security monitoring tools in an attempt to reduce the number of alerts received by administrators without missing important security events. He decides to configure the system to only report failed login attempts if there are five failed attempts to access the same account within a one-hour period of time. What term best describes the technique that Tom is using?",
        options: [
            "A. Thresholding",
            "B. Sampling",
            "C. Account lockout",
            "D. Clipping"
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["D"],
        explanation: "Clipping is an analysis technique that reports alerts only after they exceed a set threshold. It is a specific form of sampling, which is a more general term that describes any attempt to excerpt records for review. Thresholding is not a commonly used term. Administrators may choose to configure automatic or manual account lockout after failed login attempts, but that is not described in the scenario."

    {
        question: "14. Sally has been tasked with deploying an authentication, authorization, and accounting server for wireless network services in her organization and needs to avoid using proprietary technology. What technology should she select?",
        options: [
            "A. OAuth",
            "B. RADIUS",
            "C. XTACACS",
            "D. OpenID Connect"
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["B"],
        explanation: "RADIUS is a common AAA technology used to provide services for dial-up, wireless networks, network devices, and a range of other systems. OAuth is an authorization protocol used to allow applications to act on a user's behalf without sharing the password and is used for many web applications. OpenID Connect is an authentication layer on top of OAuth that allows clients to verify the identity of an end user. XTACACS, an earlier protocol for network authentication, has largely been superseded by more secure and robust protocols like RADIUS, and its proprietary nature does not fit Sally's criteria."

He pulled total payroll expenses for the pay period before the new person was hired and then pulled the same expenses for the following pay period. He computed the difference between those two amounts to determine the individual's salary. What type of attack occurred?",
        options: [

            "D. Social engineering"
        ],
        correctAnswers: ["C"],
        explanation: "In an inference attack, the attacker uses several pieces of generic nonsensitive information to determine a specific sensitive value. In a salami slicing attack, the attacker siphons off minute quantities of money many times to accumulate a large amount of funds. In a data diddling attack, the attacker alters the contents of a database. Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology to achieve their goals."

In this scenario, if Alice has the take right over Bob and Bob has read permissions on an object, Alice can use the Take rule to grant herself the read permissions that Bob possesses. The Grant rule is for granting rights to other subjects, not for taking them for oneself. The Create rule is used to create new objects or rights, not to transfer existing ones.

Sampling is an effective process if it is done on a truly random sample of sufficient size to provide effective coverage of the userbase. It is infeasible for a single person to review every single record. In an organization of 50,000 users with a 24% annual turnover, it is likely that at least 1,000 of those records have changed in the last month. This is still too many records to review.

        explanation: "Rainbow tables use precomputed password hashes to conduct cracking attacks against password files. They may be frustrated by the use of salting, which adds a specified value to the password prior to hashing, making it much more difficult to perform precomputation.

It is a very broad standard. The due diligence principle is a more specific component of due care that states that an individual assigned a responsibility should exercise due care to complete it accurately and in a timely manner.

        explanation: "All of these controls are good practices for protecting sensitive information. However, Perry is most concerned about the risk of interception while in transit over the Internet. Transport encryption would, therefore, be the most appropriate control, as anyone intercepting the information would be unable to read its contents. Storage encryption would protect against the theft of information at rest, rather than in transit over a network. Classification and labeling would not protect against interception. Data loss prevention technology may block the transfer entirely and would not meet the business requirement if it blocked the transmission and would not meet the security requirement if it did not detect the data transfer."

They do also serve to deny, detect, and delay intrusions depending upon their training. Lighting also deters attacks by making potential intrusions more visible, reducing the likelihood that an intruder will enter a well-lit area.

        explanation: "Web applications communicate with web browsers via an interface, making interface testing the best answer here. Regression testing might be used as part of the interface test but is too specific to be the best answer. Similarly, the test might be a white-box, or full knowledge, test, but interface testing better describes this specific example. Fuzzing is less likely a part of a browser compatibility test, as it tests unexpected inputs, rather than functionality."

        explanation: "The Simple Security Property prevents an individual from reading information at a higher security level than their clearance allows. This is also known as the 'no read up' rule. The Simple Integrity Property says that a subject cannot read an object at a lower integrity level (no read down). The *-Security Property says that users can't write data to a lower security level than their own. The Discretionary Security Property allows the use of a matrix to determine access permissions."

        explanation: "Network Access Control (NAC) systems can be used to authenticate users and then validate their system's compliance with a security standard before they are allowed to connect to the network. Enforcing security profiles can help reduce zero-day attacks, making NAC a useful solution. A firewall can't enforce system security policies, whereas an IDS can only monitor for attacks and alarm when they happen. Thus, neither a firewall nor an IDS meets Kolin's needs. Finally, port security is a MAC address-based security feature that can restrict only which systems or devices can connect to a given port."

The fact that the team later remediated the vulnerability could be noted in the report, but it does not change the result of the scan or its classification. True negatives occur when scans correctly note the absence of a vulnerability. False positives occur when scans report the presence of a vulnerability that does not actually exist.

        correctAnswers: ["A"],
        explanation: "Directory indexing may not initially seem like an issue during a penetration test, but simply knowing the name and location of files can provide an attacker with quite a bit of information about an organization, as well as a list of potentially accessible files. XDRF is not a type of attack, and indexing is not a denial-of-service attack vector. Directory indexing being turned on is typically either due to design or because the server was misconfigured at setup, rather than being a sign of attack."
